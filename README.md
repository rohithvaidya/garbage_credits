# garbage_credits
Backend developed during hackathon at sandbox startups 


Idea - When the user goes near a truck with his NFC(near field communication) enabled phone , his garbage deposit is recorded . 
       This is converted to credits which can be exchanged for goodies . 
       
       This is in accordance with Swachh Bharat Mission
